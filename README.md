# Color-Object-Follower
* The color object follower is a robot with the ability to detect an objectâ€™s color in a enclosed area and track it. 
* The robot detects rudimentary colors that are bright and distinct (Red, Yellow, Green, Blue, etc).
* The colors of the object is going to be picked up by the camera which will be the PixyCam.
* The robot consists the HC-06 bluetooth IC, Arduino Uno microcontroller, and the L293D H-Bridge.
* Use of this was to do a drive test using the app called Arduino RC to control the remotely control the robot and further test the wheels and motors.
* The color object follower is a significant project which in real life, it could be in use as a fundamental for kids today in learning their colors.

PixyCam
* Has the ability to select a certain color and then detect around its environment any object that has the same color.
* Features a calibration tool that adjust the range and quality when detecting the object at first sight.
* Offers the ability to output the X/Y location of the the object as well as the height and width.

L293D H-bridge 
* The L293D H-bridge is important, because it drives the DC motors using a bit of programming from the Arduino IDE.
* Configure the basic movements of the robot (forward, backward, turning left, and turning right).

HC-06 Bluetooth IC 
* Transmit and receive data back and forth between the Arduino Uno and smart phone.
